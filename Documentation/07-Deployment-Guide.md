## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code

1. **Make sure everything is working:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:5173 and test all features.

2. **Build the project** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This checks for build errors before deploying.

3. **Commit all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   ```

**Time**: ~2 minutes

---

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `portfolio` (or any name)
   - Privacy: Private (recommended) or Public
   - **Don't** initialize with README
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Connect your local code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   # Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio.git
   
   # Push code
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## üåê Custom Domain Setup

Want to use your own domain (e.g., `yourname.com`)?

### Prerequisites

- Own a domain (buy from GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
- Have access to DNS settings

### Steps

1. **In Vercel dashboard:**
   - Click your project
   - Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
   - Click "Add"
   - Enter your domain: `yourname.com`
   - Click "Add"

2. **Configure DNS** (in your domain provider):

   Vercel will show you DNS records to add. Typically:

   **For root domain** (`yourname.com`):
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 76.76.21.21
   ```

   **For www** (`www.yourname.com`):
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   ```

3. **Wait for DNS propagation** (5 minutes to 48 hours)

4. **Verify** - Visit your domain!

**Automatic HTTPS** is set up by Vercel (SSL certificates).

## üîÑ Automatic Deployments

Every time you push to GitHub, Vercel automatically:

1. Detects the new code
2. Builds the project
3. Runs tests
4. Deploys to production
5. Sends you a notification

### Making Updates

```bash
# 1. Make changes to your code
# Edit files in your editor

# 2. Test locally
npm run dev:full

# 3. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Updated homepage"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 5. Vercel auto-deploys (watch in dashboard)
# Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
```

**Deployment time**: 1-2 minutes

---

## üé® Preview Deployments

Vercel creates preview deployments for branches and pull requests:

### Create Preview

```bash
# Create new branch
git checkout -b new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push branch
git push origin new-feature
```

**Result:**
- Vercel creates preview deployment
- Get unique URL: `https://portfolio-abc123.vercel.app`
- Test changes without affecting production
- Merge when ready

---

## üìä Monitoring Your Site

### Vercel Dashboard

View important metrics:

**Analytics** (free tier includes):
- Page views

# API keys
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

**Remember**: Variables starting with `VITE_` are available in frontend.

---

### Custom Headers

Already configured in `public/_headers`:

```
/*
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

**These are automatically applied** by Vercel.

---

### Redirects

Add to `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/old-page",
      "destination": "/new-page",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 404 Page

Already included: `src/routes/NotFound.tsx`

Vercel automatically serves this for 404 errors.

---

## üêõ Deployment Troubleshooting

### Build Failed

**Check build logs:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click failed deployment
3. View logs for errors

**Common issues:**

**TypeScript errors:**
```bash
# Fix locally first
npm run typecheck

# Fix errors shown
# Then deploy again
```

**Missing dependencies:**
```bash
# Make sure package.json is up to date
npm install
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update dependencies"
git push
```

**Environment variables:**
- Check they're set correctly
- No typos in names
- Values are correct

---

### Site Not Loading

**Check these:**

1. **Deployment status** - Is it "Ready"?
2. **DNS settings** - Correct if using custom domain
3. **Browser cache** - Try incognito/private mode
4. **Console errors** - Check browser console (F12)

---

### API Errors

**Contact form not working?**

1. **Check environment variables:**
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` is set
   - `VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL` is set
   - No extra spaces

2. **Check function logs:**
   - Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Functions
   - Look for `/api/contact` errors
   - Read error messages

3. **Test API directly:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-site.vercel.app/api/contact \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@test.com","subject":"Test","message":"Test message","captchaAnswer":"5","captchaQuestion":"3 + 2 = ?"}'
   ```

---

### Slow Performance

**Optimize:**

1. **Images** - Compress before uploading
2. **Dependencies** - Remove unused packages
3. **Code splitting** - Already done by Vite
4. **Caching** - Automatic on Vercel

**Check performance:**
- Use Lighthouse (F12 ‚Üí Lighthouse)
- Aim for 90+ scores
- Follow suggestions

---

## üîí Security After Deployment

### Immediate Steps

- [ ] Test HTTPS works (https://your-site.com)
- [ ] Verify security headers (use https://securityheaders.com)
- [ ] Test contact form spam protection
- [ ] Check CORS is working
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works

### Ongoing

- [ ] Monitor error logs weekly
- [ ] Check for suspicious activity
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Test security features after updates

---

## üìà Performance Tips

### Optimize Images

**Before adding images:**
```bash
# Use tools like:
- TinyPNG (https://tinypng.com)
- ImageOptim (Mac)
- Squoosh (https://squoosh.app)
```

**Good practices:**
- Use WebP format when possible
- Compress JPEG/PNG
- Max width: 1920px for full-width images
- Use appropriate sizes

### Lazy Loading

Images already lazy load with React:
```tsx
<img 
  src="/images/large-image.jpg" 
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Description"
/>
```

### Code Splitting

Vite automatically splits code into chunks. You can optimize further:

```typescript
// Lazy load routes
const About = lazy(() => import('./routes/About'))
const Projects = lazy(() => import('./routes/Projects'))
```

---

## üìä Analytics Setup (Optional)

### Google Analytics

1. **Get tracking ID** from Google Analytics

2. **Add to environment variables:**
   ```
   VITE_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
   ```

3. **Add to `index.html`:**
   ```html
   <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
   <script>
     window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
     function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
     gtag('js', new Date());
     gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
   </script>
   ```
