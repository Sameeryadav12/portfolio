## ✨ Tips for Beginners

### If You're New to Programming

1. **Take it slow** - Don't try to understand everything at once
2. **Start with the basics** - Follow the Getting Started guide first
3. **Read the error messages** - They often tell you what's wrong
4. **Use the browser console** - Press F12 to see helpful information
5. **Make backups** - Use Git to save your progress
6. **Ask questions** - Search online or check the documentation

### Best Practices

- ✅ Always test locally before deploying
- ✅ Keep your API keys secret (never commit them to Git)
- ✅ Read error messages carefully
- ✅ Make small changes and test often
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Use version control (Git)

### Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Not reading error messages
- ❌ Skipping the setup steps
- ❌ Not saving files before testing
- ❌ Forgetting to restart the server after changes
- ❌ Exposing API keys in public repositories
- ❌ Not testing before deploying
