# 📧 Email Timing Guide

## ⏰ **How Long Does It Take to Receive Emails?**

### **Current Setup (Test reCAPTCHA):**
- ✅ **Form submits successfully**
- ✅ **API processes the request**
- ✅ **Resend API sends the email**
- ⏰ **Email delivery: 1-5 minutes**

### **Why It Takes Time:**

1. **API Processing**: 1-2 seconds
2. **Resend API**: 1-3 seconds to send
3. **Email Provider**: 1-5 minutes to deliver
4. **Gmail/Outlook**: May take up to 10 minutes in rare cases

## 🎯 **What Happens When You Submit:**

### **Step-by-Step Process:**
```
1. You fill form and check reCAPTCHA ✓
2. Click Submit
3. Form validates (1 second)
4. API receives data (1 second)
5. reCAPTCHA verification (1 second) - now allows test key
6. Email sent via Resend (2-3 seconds)
7. Resend delivers to Gmail (1-5 minutes)
8. Email appears in your inbox ✉️
```

## 📊 **Expected Timeline:**

| Time | What's Happening |
|------|------------------|
| **0-5 seconds** | Form validation & API processing |
| **5-10 seconds** | Email sent via Resend API |
| **1-5 minutes** | Email delivered to `rishisameer7@gmail.com` |
| **5-10 minutes** | (Rare cases) Email may take longer |

## 🔍 **How to Check if Email Was Sent:**

### **Check Browser Console (F12):**
Look for these messages:
```
✅ "Sending email with reCAPTCHA verification..."
✅ "reCAPTCHA verification passed (or allowed for testing)"
✅ "Email sent successfully!"
```

### **Check Vercel Function Logs:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Functions" tab
4. Look for `/api/contact` logs

## 🚨 **If You Don't Receive Email After 10 Minutes:**

### **Possible Issues:**

1. **Check Spam Folder** 📧
   - Look in Gmail Spam/Junk folder
   - Check Promotions tab

2. **Check Email Address** 📧
   - Verify it's going to `rishisameer7@gmail.com`
   - Not `ysameer0303@gmail.com`

3. **Resend API Issues** 🔧
   - Check if `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Vercel
   - Check Vercel function logs for errors

4. **Rate Limiting** ⏱️
   - You can only send 1 email per minute
   - Wait 1 minute between tests
